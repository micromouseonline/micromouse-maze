/*
 * The PathFinder class examines a properly flooded maze and uses its data
 * to construct a path for the mouse to follow.
 *
 * A basic path is a simple character string. Each letter in the string
 * represents a command for the robot in a cell of the maze.
 *
 * PathString commands
 *  'B' : Begin path. Must be present. No motion. Robot initialisation.
 *  'F' : Move forward one cell.
 *  'R' : Turn right in place.
 *  'L' : Turn left in place.
 *  'S' : Stop moving. Robot centered in the cell.
 *  'X' : Explore. Robot centered in the cell, moving at explore speed
 *
 *
 *  A PathString can be converted into a series of mouse commands. Each command
 *  is a single byte representing more complex behaviour.
 *
 *  The simplest level effectively run length encodes the PathString and
 *  generates smooth turns for each 'L' or 'R' instruction.
 *
 *  The more complex version produces a set of instructions that will
 *  resulting a fast run using diagonals. This command list must obey a
 *  basic syntax as illustrated below.
 *
 *  Note that there must be a start command and one of the two finish commands.
 *  Every turn has a straight move before and after it. Straight moves are
 *  either orthogonal or diagonal.

 *
 *
 *  The basic PathString is stored in a buffer held by the PathFinder class so
 *  that it is available to generate command lists of different kinds.
 *
 *  The command lists are created in buffers provided by the caller.
 *
 *  Thus, the caller is responsible for managing the storage allocation and
 *  de-allocation. The Pathfinder will not create any objects that it does not
 *  then destroy.
 *
 *  The Pathfinder assumes it may be used on a half size maze so the maximum path
 *  length is large.
 *
 *  In the unlikely event it became necessary to save memory or accommodate
 *  different size mazes/paths, it may be appropriate to subclass a simpler
 *  version intended only for the classic contest
